\section{Methods}
In this study, human proteome and mouse proteome has been extracted from UniProtKB/SwissProt \cite{2007}. There are a total of 20106 entries for human and 16854 entries for mouse has been used to conduct this study. DPP4 substrate degradomes for both human and mouse are acquired from previous study based on UniProtKB/SwissProt human/mouse proteomes(ref), which consists of 153 entries and 96 entries for human and mouse DPP4 substrate degradome respectively. 

In order to check if all human DPP4 substrate has a corresponding mouse representation, each DPP4 substrate human entries has been blasted against the mouse DPP4 substrate degradome.  the difference between the
