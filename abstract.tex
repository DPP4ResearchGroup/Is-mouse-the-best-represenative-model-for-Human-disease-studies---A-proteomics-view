\Regardless popular demand for mouse models in biomedical research, concerns regarding whether mouse model is appropriate for all human disease studies persist. Mouse and human shares many similar physiological and molecular features. Nevertheless, the distinct difference between the two spices at molecular level can not be ignored, particular high attrition rate in phase II new drug clinical trails highlight the lack of comprehensive understanding of molecular and physiological difference between human and mouse. In this study, we are trying to use bioinformatics approach to depict the different of substrate degradome of DPP4 between human and mouse. DPP4 is an important exo-protease and regulates many important biological molecules including the immune system response, cellular homeostasis and DPP4 is a therapeutic target for managing type-2 diabetes.
