\section{Discussions and Future Study}
Unlike the experimental workflow, bioinformatics research is rather focusing on finding hidden links/relationships within existing knowledge base. Therefore, this bioinformatics pipeline is highly dependent on the high quality sequence annotations. However, at current stage, the exclusive annotation of mouse proteome is yet complete.
