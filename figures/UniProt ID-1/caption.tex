Human DPP4 substrates that no mouse counterpart exist. The discrepancies due mainly to the less conservation in amino acids between human and mouse. There is also incidence where the divergence also exist in normally highly conserved N-terminus, for instance, human IL-10 and mouse equivalence have "SP" and "SR" N-terminal dipeptides respectively.
