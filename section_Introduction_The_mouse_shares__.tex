\section{Introduction}

The mouse shares its majority protein encoding genes with human and is arguably one of the most popular research models for human disease. One significant benefits of utilizing a rodent model is fast and economical breading in captivity \cite{Rosenthal_2007}, which allows fast tract experimental results. \cite{Vandamme_2014} 

Dispite the dominant application of mouse models in biomedical researches, recent studies have also highlighted the high degree divergence between human and mouse genome in regarding to transcription regulations. \cite{25409824}
