\section{Introduction}

Dispite the dominant application of mouse models in biomedical researches, Arguable the mouse is one of the most well studied animal body in molecular biology. 
The mouse shares its majority protein encoding genes with human and makes it a popular research model for human disease. 
The argument 

One significant benifits of ultilising a rodent model is arguablly the fast turn over rate and this allows fast tract a consequence regarding to the implementation. \cite{Vandamme_2014}

Recent study has also highlighted the divergence nature of human and mouse DNA
