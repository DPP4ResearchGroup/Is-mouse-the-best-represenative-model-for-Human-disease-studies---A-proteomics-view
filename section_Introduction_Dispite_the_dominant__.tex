\section{Introduction}

Dispite the dominant application of mouse models in biomedical researches, Arguable the mouse is one of the most well studied animal body in molecular biology. 

The mouse shares its majority protein encoding genes with human and is arguably one of the most popular research models for human disease. One significant benefits of utilizing a rodent model is fast and economical breading in captivity \cite{Rosenthal_2007}, which allows fast tract experimental results. \cite{Vandamme_2014} 

Recent study has also highlighted the divergence nature of human and mouse DNA
