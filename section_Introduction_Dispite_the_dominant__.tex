\section{Introduction}

Dispite the dominant application of mouse models in biomedical researches, Arguable the mouse is one of the most well studied animal body in molecular biology. 

The mouse shares its majority protein encoding genes with human and is arguably one of the most popular research models for human disease. The significant benefits of utilizing a rodent model (particular the mouse models) are including fast and economical in breading; to maintain this allows fast tract a consequence regarding the implementation. \cite{Vandamme_2014}

Recent study has also highlighted the divergence nature of human and mouse DNA
